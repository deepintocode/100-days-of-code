# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Object Oriented Programming section.

**Thoughts:** Today marks 5 years since the day that I quit smoking, so I thought getting started with another challenge is a great way to celebrate. Feeling really good about myself!
