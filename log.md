# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Object Oriented Programming section.

**Thoughts:** Today marks 5 years since the day that I quit smoking, so I thought getting started with another challenge is a great way to celebrate. Feeling really good about myself!

### Day 2: August 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Functional Programming section.

**Thoughts:** It seems like I'm working towards my goal, so I'm happy!

### Day 3: August 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification section! 

Solved an issue that our [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) app was having. 

**Thoughts:** Still not entirely sure how Array.prototype.reduce works and never understood what the case with our Chingu app was. At least it's working now for some reason...

### Day 4: August 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had some fun with [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)

Finished [FreeCodeCamp's React section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react)

**Thoughts:** I want to get better with CSS, so I thought Flexbox Froggy was a good way to do that. Indeed, it was! The React section of FreeCodeCamp turned out to be quite easy, since I'm quite familiarised with the basics of React at this point.

### Day 5: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's Redux section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/redux)

**Thoughts:** Today, I went to the beach, so it was a fun day, but I learned that a sunburn and a headache do not help with coding. I also think that it's quite early to learn Redux, when I don't really feel comfortable with React...

### Day 6: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's React and Redux section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react-and-redux)

**Thoughts:** Redux is really going over my head at the moment. I should finish the Responsive Web Design Certification and then go on with the Front End Library Certification me thinks...

### Day 7: August 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's Data Visualization with D3 section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-with-d3/)

**Thoughts:** The later in the day it gets, the harder to code it becomes...

### Day 8: August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an Address Book App written in Javascript using Materialize CSS

**Thoughts:** Today, I ran into a problem that I wouldn't have if I was using React instead of plain JavaScript. So, I think I'm getting there. Wherever there is...

### Day 9: August 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished [FreeCodeCamp's JSON API and Ajax Section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/json-apis-and-ajax)

**Thoughts:** Today, I realised why you need the Fetch API or the Axios library. XMLHttpRequest looks really bad compared to them...

### Day 10: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got [FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification](https://learn.freecodecamp.org)!

**Thoughts:** I was postponing the Technical Documentation project for quite a while. Doesn't sound that interesting, does it? It looks ugly but it's done, so I'm happy!

### Day 11: August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's NPM Package Management and Basic Node & Express](https://learn.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** The NPM packages were nothing new to me. However, while I have worked with Express a bit, this time it kind of clicked more and now seems relatively easy.

### Day 12: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished [FreeCodeCamp's Markdown Previewer](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer).

**Thoughts:** Wasted a lot of time trying to get FreeCodeCamp's tests to pass, only to get some help online and then find out that it wasn't enough to import the marked module, but you also had to link the CDN, which is quite unfortunate and is in need of a redesign.

### Day 13: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Chingu's Voyage 6 project which is now nearly done.

**Thoughts:** Chingu's project has been a great way to get familiar with React, but there are times when I still don't have a clue as to what I'm doing...

### Day 14: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had a bit of a break from JavaScript and played around with Python and Pandas.

**Thoughts:** I'm usually trying to avoid working with other languages until I have a firm grasp of JavaScript, but I've been working with JavaScript long enough and I have played around with Python in the past, so I think I should be fine.

### Day 15: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Timestamp Microservice project on [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

**Thoughts:** Why JavaScript, why? Why do you need undefined, false, null, '', NaN? Why do you need so many falsy values??
