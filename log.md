# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Object Oriented Programming section.

**Thoughts:** Today marks 5 years since the day that I quit smoking, so I thought getting started with another challenge is a great way to celebrate. Feeling really good about myself!

### Day 3: August 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification section! Solved an issue that our [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) app was having. 

**Thoughts:** Still not entirely sure how Array.prototype.reduce works and never understood what the case with our Chingu app was. At least it's working now for some reason...
