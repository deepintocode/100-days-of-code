# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Object Oriented Programming section.

**Thoughts:** Today marks 5 years since the day that I quit smoking, so I thought getting started with another challenge is a great way to celebrate. Feeling really good about myself!

### Day 2: August 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Functional Programming section.

**Thoughts:** It seems like I'm working towards my goal, so I'm happy!

### Day 3: August 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification section! 

Solved an issue that our [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) app was having. 

**Thoughts:** Still not entirely sure how Array.prototype.reduce works and never understood what the case with our Chingu app was. At least it's working now for some reason...

### Day 4: August 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had some fun with [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)

Finished [FreeCodeCamp's React section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react)

**Thoughts:** I want to get better with CSS, so I thought Flexbox Froggy was a good way to do that. Indeed, it was! The React section of FreeCodeCamp turned out to be quite easy, since I'm quite familiarised with the basics of React at this point.

### Day 5: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's Redux section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/redux)

**Thoughts:** Today, I went to the beach, so it was a fun day, but I learned that a sunburn and a headache do not help with coding. I also think that it's quite early to learn Redux, when I don't really feel comfortable with React...

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/redux)

### Day 6: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's React and Redux section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react-and-redux)

**Thoughts:** Redux is really going over my head at the moment. I should finish the Responsive Web Design Certification and then go on with the Front End Library Certification me thinks...

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react-and-redux)

### Day 7: August 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's Data Visualization with D3 section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-with-d3/)

**Thoughts:** The later in the day it gets, the harder to code it becomes...

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-with-d3/)

### Day 8: August 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on an Address Book App written in Javascript using Materialize CSS

**Thoughts:** Today, I ran into a problem that I wouldn't have if I was using React instead of plain JavaScript. So, I think I'm getting there. Wherever there is...

**Link to work:** [Address Book App](https://github.com/deepintocode/address-book)

### Day 9: August 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished [FreeCodeCamp's JSON API and Ajax Section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/json-apis-and-ajax)

**Thoughts:** Today, I realised why you need the Fetch API or the Axios library. XMLHttpRequest looks really bad compared to them...

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCamp's JSON API and Ajax Section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/json-apis-and-ajax)

### Day 10: August 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got [FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification](https://learn.freecodecamp.org)!

**Thoughts:** I was postponing the Technical Documentation project for quite a while. Doesn't sound that interesting, does it? It looks ugly but it's done, so I'm happy!

**Link to work:** [Technical Documentation project on CodePen](https://codepen.io/deepintocode/pen/pZGvLX)

### Day 11: August 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's NPM Package Management and Basic Node & Express](https://learn.freecodecamp.org).

**Thoughts:** The NPM packages were nothing new to me. However, while I have worked with Express a bit, this time it kind of clicked more and now seems relatively easy.

**Link to work:** [Npm Package Management](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/managing-packages-with-npm)

[Basic Node and Express](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/basic-node-and-express)

### Day 12: August 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished [FreeCodeCamp's Markdown Previewer](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-markdown-previewer).

**Thoughts:** Wasted a lot of time trying to get FreeCodeCamp's tests to pass, only to get some help online and then find out that it wasn't enough to import the marked module, but you also had to link the CDN, which is quite unfortunate and is in need of a redesign.

### Day 13: August 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on Chingu's Voyage 6 project which is now nearly done.

**Thoughts:** Chingu's project has been a great way to get familiar with React, but there are times when I still don't have a clue as to what I'm doing...

**Link to work:** [Chingu App Repo](https://github.com/chingu-voyage6/Geckos-Team-30)

### Day 14: August 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had a bit of a break from JavaScript and played around with Python and Pandas.

**Thoughts:** I'm usually trying to avoid working with other languages until I have a firm grasp of JavaScript, but I've been working with JavaScript long enough and I have played around with Python in the past, so I think I should be fine.

### Day 15: August 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Timestamp Microservice project on [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)

**Thoughts:** Why JavaScript, why? Why do you need undefined, false, null, '', NaN? Why do you need so many falsy values??

**Link to work:** [Timestamp Microservice project on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/timestamp-microservice)

### Day 16: August 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the [Chingu App](https://github.com/chingu-voyage6/Geckos-Team-30) for Chingu Voyage 6!

**Thoughts:** The app is not perfect by any means, but it works (for the most part), so there's that!

**Link to work:** [Chingu App](https://github.com/chingu-voyage6/Geckos-Team-30).

### Day 17: August 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the [Exercise Tracker](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker) project in the Apis and Microservices section of FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I think I'm starting to like using Express.

**Link to work:** [Exercise Tracker Repo](https://github.com/deepintocode/exercise-tracker).

### Day 18: August 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had a play around with tidalcycles, supercollider, tensorflow and mljs

**Thoughts:** It was a bit of an experimental day!

### Day 19: August 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the [Exercise Tracker](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker) project in the Apis and Microservices section of FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** Got stuck with the logic behind an array, but managed to get out of the loop, so all is well.

**Link to work:** [Exercise Tracker Repo](https://github.com/deepintocode/exercise-tracker).

### Day 20: August 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's [Mongo and Mongoose challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/mongodb-and-mongoose).

**Thoughts:** It's taking a while to get my head around mongo and mongoose.

**Link to work:** FreeCodeCamp's [Mongo and Mongoose challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/mongodb-and-mongoose).

### Day 21: August 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's [Exercise Tracker Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker).

**Thoughts:** Databases are not very fun.

**Link to work:** FreeCodeCamp's [Exercise Tracker Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker).

### Day 22: August 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's [Exercise Tracker Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker).

**Thoughts:** Mongoose can be relatively simple or extremely complicated.

**Link to work:** Finished FreeCodeCamp's [Exercise Tracker Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker).

### Day 23: August 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on FreeCodeCamp's [Drum Machine](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).

**Thoughts:** It's nice to be back to working with React.

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/drum_machine).

### Day 24: August 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's [Drum Machine](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).

**Thoughts:** The drum machine is making sound, it's displaying the sound's name, but it's not looking great... Yet!

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/drum_machine).

## Day 25: August 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's [Drum Machine](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).

**Thoughts:** I took some time to refactor yesterday's code and it looks much better. I thought that having a switch statement for nine cases was not optimal... (Hint: It wasn't)

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/drum_machine).

## Day 26: August 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's [Drum Machine](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-drum-machine).

**Thoughts:** Didn't have a lot of time today, so I didn't reach the point I wanted, but I think the app looks presentable.

**Link to work:** [Drum Machine repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/drum_machine).

## Day 27: August 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had a play around with physics, machine learning, ml5js and brain.js.

**Thoughts:** Occasionally, I need to have some breaks from pure web development...

## Day 28: August 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's [URL Shortener](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice/).

**Thoughts:** Today, I am quite annoyed with how Mongoose works, the little differences between MongoDB and deprecated Mongoose methods. However, Mongoose is like a dream compared to git. Small piece of advice. Do not try to run "git reset --hard" if you haven't committed anything, because you will delete all the files of the repository. Tomorrow will be a better day...

**Link to work:** FreeCodeCamp's [URL Shortener](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice/).

## Day 29: August 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's [URL Shortener](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice/).

**Thoughts:** Reached the same point that I reached yesterday before I deleted everything... Kind of a redundant day.

**Link to work:** FreeCodeCamp's [URL Shortener](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice/).

## Day 30: August 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's [URL Shortener](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/url-shortener-microservice/).

**Thoughts:** Getting closer to finishing another section on FreeCodeCamp. Yay!!

**Link to work:** FreeCodeCamp's [URL Shortener repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/URL_Shortener).

## Day 31: August 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's [File Metadata Microservice](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/file-metadata-microservice) and got the APIs and Microservices certification!!

**Thoughts:** Got my third FreeCodeCamp certification today, so I'm quite happy!

**Link to work:** FreeCodeCamp's [File Metadata Microservice repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/file_metadata).

## Day 32: September 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's [Bar Chart with d3js](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-bar-chart.

**Thoughts:** I think FreeCodeCamp's D3 section is not very well thought and it's quite hard to find good examples online.

**Link to work:** FreeCodeCamp's [Bar Chart repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/bar_chart).

## Day 33: September 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Another day of playing around with tidalcycles

**Thoughts:** I'm really starting to like live coding and the way of thought behind tidalcycles. Maybe it's good enough to get me back into writing music.

## Day 34: September 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Trying to complete FreeCodeCamp's bar chart with d3js...

**Thoughts:** Completing FreeCodeCamp's Data Visualization section is turning out to be quite hard and I don't think I can make it without looking into D3 through extra sources.

## Day 35: September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a Clash Royale App written in React

**Thoughts:** Had some troubles with the asynchronous nature of Javascript and React state. Maybe Javascript could take into account its own nature and stop throwing undefined left and right... Just wait a bit and it will be defined!!

## Day 36: September 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Working with React. React lifecycle methods, React router and their relationship with JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** When you think that you understand something and then you realise you don't really...

## Day 37: September 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: React, react, react

**Thoughts:** The react way of routing is quite different compared to static routing.

## Day 38: September 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Studied React's lifecycle methods

**Thoughts:** I'm getting used to React's way of thinking. At least I think so at the moment...

## Day 39: September 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had fun with p5js

**Thoughts:** I want to mix creative coding into my coding endeavours. I think it spices things up and will probably help in the long run.

**Link to work:** [p5js Experiments repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/p5js_Experiments).

## Day 40: September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had some fun with tidalcycles and got a new domain name for my creative coding efforts.

**Thoughts:** Live coding with tidalcycles is really fun, albeit a bit confusing to begin with.

**Link to work:** [Tidalcycles cycles repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/tidalcycles_cycles).

## Day 41: September 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went back to playing with React and React router.

**Thoughts:** I still find styling hard. Maybe I should look back into CSS and try and improve my design skills.

## Day 42: September 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still trying to find my way around React.

**Thoughts:** Spent the day mostly reading and watching videos about React. Feels a bit like going around in circles.

## Day 43: September 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript calculator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator).

**Thoughts:** I'm not sure if adding API calls to React makes it harder, but when I don't have to deal with that things seem easier.

**Link to work:** [React calculator repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/calculator).

## Day 44: September 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript calculator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) and a bit of P5js.

**Thoughts:** Note to self: Read the entire guidelines BEFORE you start coding!!

**Link to work:** [React calculator repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/calculator).

## Day 45: September 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript calculator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) and a bit of P5js.

**Thoughts:** I wasn't expecting that building a calculator would be this tricky...

**Link to work:** [React calculator repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/calculator).

## Day 46: September 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished [FreeCodeCamp's JavaScript calculator](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator).

**Thoughts:** One more project left to finish the front end libraries projects on FreeCodeCamp!! Getting there!

**Link to work:** [React calculator repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/calculator).

## Day 47: September 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started building a new blog using Gatsbyjs and played with p5js for a bit.

**Thoughts:** Using a technology that's based on Reactjs kind of feels good.

## Day 48: September 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: P5js for today.

**Thoughts:** Probably going back to React, or Gatsby tomorrow.

## Day 49: September 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started working on [FreeCodeCamp's pomodoro clock](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock).

**Thoughts:** I don't really have issues shifting from React to p5js, or even to pure Processing, so I'm guessing it shouldn't be an issue mixing up a few languages at this point.

**Link to work:** [React pomodoro clock repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/pomodoro_clock).

## Day 50: September 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished [FreeCodeCamp's pomodoro clock](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-pomodoro-clock). Kind of...

**Thoughts:** While the pomodoro clock seems to be working just fine, a couple of tests are failing. Not really a fan of the way FreeCodeCamp's tests are working. 

**Link to work:** [React pomodoro clock repo on Github](https://github.com/deepintocode/pomodoro_clock).

## Day 51: September 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: A bit of p5js for good measure

**Thoughts:** Busy day, so not a lot of coding for today.

## Day 52: September 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Fixed my pomodoro clock's issues and then dwelved into processing. Actual Processing, not p5js.

**Thoughts:** Getting into Processing... Java... I've done this before. Doesn't seem that bad at this point.

## Day 53: September 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went through the official Gatsbyjs tutorial and explored physics engine basics in Processing.

**Thoughts:** Gatsby is still a bit too much for me. I'm not sure if it's Gatsby or GraphQL though...

# Day 54: September 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished [FreeCodeCamp's Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/information-security-and-quality-assurance/quality-assurance-and-testing-with-chai)

**Thoughts:** Don't really feel that I'm learning in some sections of FreeCodeCamp. This was definitely one of them.

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCamp's Quality Assurance and Testing with Chai section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/information-security-and-quality-assurance/quality-assurance-and-testing-with-chai)

# Day 55: September 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started [FreeCodeCamp's Introduction to Advanced Node and Express Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/information-security-and-quality-assurance/advanced-node-and-express/)

**Thoughts:** Not really loving this section of FreeCodeCamp...

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCamp's Introduction to Advanced Node and Express Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/information-security-and-quality-assurance/advanced-node-and-express/)

# Day 56: September 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to make some progress with [FreeCodeCamp's Introduction to Advanced Node and Express Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/information-security-and-quality-assurance/advanced-node-and-express/) and eventually gave up.

**Thoughts:** I'm going to leave this section of FreeCodeCamp for now, because I find it very badly designed and a source of frustration...

**Link to work:** [FreeCodeCamp's Introduction to Advanced Node and Express Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/information-security-and-quality-assurance/advanced-node-and-express/)

# Day 57: September 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Went back to the basics and started re-reading the [You Don't Know JS series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), which is highly recommended.

**Thoughts:** While these books are good, they always include some baffling examples of code that make you wonder if you really know what you're doing. Then again, that's probably why they do it...
