# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: August 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Object Oriented Programming section.

**Thoughts:** Today marks 5 years since the day that I quit smoking, so I thought getting started with another challenge is a great way to celebrate. Feeling really good about myself!

### Day 2: August 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on FreeCodeCamp's Functional Programming section.

**Thoughts:** It seems like I'm working towards my goal, so I'm happy!

### Day 3: August 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification section! 

Solved an issue that our [Chingu](https://chingu.io/) app was having. 

**Thoughts:** Still not entirely sure how Array.prototype.reduce works and never understood what the case with our Chingu app was. At least it's working now for some reason...

### Day 4: August 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Had some fun with [Flexbox Froggy](http://flexboxfroggy.com/)

Finished [FreeCodeCamp's React section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react)

**Thoughts:** I want to get better with CSS, so I thought Flexbox Froggy was a good way to do that. Indeed, it was! The React section of FreeCodeCamp turned out to be quite easy, since I'm quite familiarised with the basics of React at this point.

### Day 5: August 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's Redux section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/redux)

**Thoughts:** Today, I went to the beach, so it was a fun day, but I learned that a sunburn and a headache do not help with coding. I also think that it's quite early to learn Redux, when I don't really feel comfortable with React...

### Day 6: August 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's React and Redux section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react-and-redux)

**Thoughts:** Redux is really going over my head at the moment. I should finish the Responsive Web Design Certification and then go on with the Front End Library Certification me thinks...

### Day 7: August 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on [FreeCodeCamp's Data Visualization with D3 section](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-with-d3/)

**Thoughts:** The later in the day it gets, the harder to code it becomes...
